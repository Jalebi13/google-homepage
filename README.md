 This is the first project from The Odin Project course! The task was to recreate the Google search engine homepage
 
 The 2 broad steps I went through were as follows:
 <ol>
  <li> Write up HTML - separating the document into header (top navigation bar, main (search bar and buttons), and footer.</li>
 <li> Write up the CSS code, using CSS Flex and responsive web design methods </li>
 
 Overall, I found HTML relatively straightforward, however, I did find I had to go back and add broad .container class tags so it would play nicer with CSS. It took me a minute to realise how effective the application of CSS Flex is, though I still haven't got to grips with CSS, as can be seen from the final product. I can't figure out how to separate my header and footer elements into left, middle and right.
 
 I'll take a break from CSS and come back to it as it's not something I want to get bogged down in.
